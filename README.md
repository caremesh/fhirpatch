# fhirpatch.js

This is a Javascript implementation of the FHIRPatch specification as 
described at https://www.hl7.org/fhir/fhirpatch.html.  It is mostly based
on the excellent `fhirpath.js` library, however it was determined that the 
requirements for `fhirpatch` are so different that a fork was a better option
than trying to add the functionality to `fhirpath.js`.
